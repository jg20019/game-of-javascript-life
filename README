An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.

It taught me more about the way that Javascript this works,
how to break an app into models views and controllers, even
without using a framework.

I also learned how to accumulate changes then apply them 
all at once. Changing the status of the cells, while iterating 
led to a bug where dead cells were made alive and as a result
during the rest of the iteration influenced the life of other cells.

I also learned how accumulating the updates led to more efficient
code because instead of erasing the whole canvas, I could send
a list of cells that needed to be drawn or erased only erase those 
areas instead of the entire canvas.
